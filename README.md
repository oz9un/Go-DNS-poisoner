# DNS Goisoner :vomiting_face:

An on-path DNS poisoning attack tool, written in Golang. 

Developed using the GoPacket library, supports just plain (UDP) DNS
traffic over port 53.

DNS Goisoner captures the traffic from a network interface in promiscuous mode, and injects forged
responses to selected DNS A requests with the goal of poisoning the cache of
the victim's resolver.
## Parameters & Usage ðŸ’¬

DNS Goisoner has three parameters and usage for this:
```
go run dnspoison.go [-i interface] [-f hostnames] [expression]
```

- **-i :** Listen on network device <interface> (e.g., eth0). If not specifed, default interface (eth0) will be used.
- **-f :** Read a list of IP adress and hostname pairs specifying the hostnames to be hijacked. If '-f' is not specified, DNS Goisoner will forge replies to all observed requests with the chosen interface's IP address as an answer.
- **<expression> :** It is an optional argument. It is a BPF filter that specifies a subset of the traffic to be monitored. This option is useful for targeting a single victim or a group of victims.


## Example Hostnames & Usages

Hostnames file should contain one IP and hostname pair per line, seperated by whitespace, in the following format:
```
100.90.80.70      ex.example.com
10.9.8.7          amp.example.com
192.168.62.27     le.example.com
```

Example usages:

```bash
sudo go run main.go -i ens33 -f targets.txt

sudo go run main.go -i ens33

sudo go run main.go -i wlan0 -f targets.txt "dst host 192.168.2.10"
```
